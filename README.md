# CM Project Toolbelt

## An Introduction

This tool is designed to make the process of bootstrapping a project as simple as possible, and provide a simple way to run all development tasks, subsequently brining consistency to the development process used for all projects.

Whilst it designed for internal use by those at Cubic Mushroom, it's made freely available for others to use, or adapt to their own purpose.
